        <p>Python is a high-level programming language suitable for beginners thanks to its intuitive syntax, huge community, and vibrant ecosystem. 
        Technically speaking, Python is an interpreted language that does not have an intermediate compilation phase like a compiled language, for example 
        C or Java.
        </p>

        <p>And like many interpreted languages, it is typed dynamically. This means that you do not have to indicate the types of variables you use and the 
        variables are not bound to a specific type. Python is a programming language widely used in various areas, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> It is popular for back-end web development for its simplicity, scalability, and robust frameworks like Django and Flask.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Science:</strong> Python's powerful libraries for numerical analysis, such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, make it an essential tool for data 
                scientists and analysts.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning: </strong>Python is the leading language in the field of machine learning thanks to its ease of use and frameworks.</li>
            <li><strong>Software development: </strong>It is used to create a wide range of applications, from desktop software to productivity tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation: </strong>Python's simplicity and flexibility make it ideal for automating repetitive tasks and streamlining workflows.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We can create a new Python variable by assigning a value to a label, using the assignment operator<code class="inline-code">=</code>A variable name can be composed 
            of characters, numbers, and the underscore character<code class="inline-code">_</code>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> - Variables can not start with a number.</p>

        </p>
        
        <p>In this example we assign a string with the value <code class="inline-code">"Zayleth"</code>to<code class="inline-code">name</code>
        </p>

        <p><code class="code">name = "Zayleth"</code>
        </p>

        <p>Other examples</p>

        <code class="code">name1</code>
        <code class="code">AGE</code>
        <code class="code">a11111</code>
        <code class="code">fourth_example</code>
        <code class="code">_name</code>
              
        <p>There are some keywords like 
            <code class="inline-code">for</code>
            <code class="inline-code">if</code>
            <code class="inline-code">while</code>
            <code class="inline-code">import</code> and more. There is no need to memorize them, as Python will alert you if you use one of them as a variable, and you will gradually recognize them as part of the syntax of the Python programming language.

        <article>

        <p>A statement is an operation on a value. A program is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is placed on its own line, but you can use a semicolon<code class="inline-code">;</code>to have more than one statement on a single line:
        </p>

        <code class="code">name = "Zayleth"; print(name)</code>

        <header>Comments</header>
        <article>

        <p>In a Python program, anything after a mark<code class="inline-code">#</code>is ignored and considered a comment.
        </p>

        <code class="code"> < header > Comments < /header >
            #this is a commented line</code>

        <code class="code">name = "Zayleth" #this is an inline comment </code>

        <header>Indentation</header>
        <article>

        <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. It defines the structure of your code and determines which lines belong together 
            as a block.
        </p>
        
        <p>Everything indented belongs to a block, such as a control statement or conditional block, or a function or class body. An incorrect indentation will 
            lead to syntax errors and your code won't run. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Indentation’s rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use 4 spaces for each indentation level. This is the recommended and widely adopted convention.</li>
            <li>All statements within a block must have the same indentation.</li>
            <li>Consistency is key! Maintain the same indentation throughout your code for readability.</li>
        </ul>

        <header>What is a data type?</header>
        <article>

        <p>A data type refers to the classification of values ​​that can be stored in a variable. Each type of data has specific characteristics and 
            properties that make it suitable for certain uses and operations.
        </p>

        <p>Data types are also used to determine how values ​​are stored in computer memory and how the values ​​can be manipulated and operated on. 
            For example, integers are stored as sequences of bits in memory, and arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
            and division can be performed.
        </p>

        <header>Data Types</header>
        <article>

        <p>The types of data play are crucial when building robust and efficient applications. As one of the most popular and versatile programming languages, 
            Python offers a wide range of built-in data types that make it easy to manipulate and store information. There are many data types in Python, 
            some of them are -
        </p>

        <h3>Integer (int)</h3>
        <p>Data of type int (short for "integer"), in Python, are those that represent integers. These are a type of numbers that do not have a decimal part, 
            they are complete without fractions.
        </p>
            <code class="code">1, 2, 3, 4, 5</code>

        <h3>Float</h3>
        <p>Float data (short for “floating point”), in Python, are those that represent numbers with decimals.
        </p>
            <code class="code">1.23</code>
            <code class="code">3.14</code>
            <code class="code">45.5</code>
            <code class="code">-12.34</code>
            
        <h3>Complex Numbers (complex)</h3>
        <p>Those that represent numbers that have a real part and an imaginary part. In mathematics, complex numbers are defined as the sum of a real part and 
            an imaginary part multiplied by the imaginary unit (denoted as "i" or "j").
        </p>
            
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong> - Complex data is represented by writing a real number followed by a "j" to indicate the imaginary part.</p>
    
            <code class="code">3 + 2j</code>
            <code class="code">-7.5 - 1j</code>
            <code class="code">2j</code>
        
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong> - Instead of "i", Python uses "j", to denote the imaginary unit.</p>
        
    <h3>Text Types (str)</h3>
    <p>String data (short for "character string" or "string"), in Python, is data that represents a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, symbols, etc.). 
        They are represented in single quotes<code class="inline-code">('')</code>or double quotes<code class="inline-code">("")</code>
    </p>
    
        <code class="code">"Hello World"</code>
        <code class="code">’Python is great!'</code>
        <code class="code">"1234"</code>

    <h3>Booleans (bool)</h3>
    <p>Data type bool (short for "boolean"), are those that represent truth values. In other words, they are true or false values. 
        In Python, bool data is represented as True or False (with the first letter capitalized).
    </p>
    
    <p>They are primarily used in logical and control-flow expressions, such as<code class="inline-code">if</code>and<code class="inline-code">while</code>statements.
    </p>

    <h3>Sequence types (list)</h3>

    <p>Lists are those that represent an ordered collection of elements. In other words, lists are a data structure that allows multiple values ​​to be stored 
        in a single object and accessed by their position in the list. List-type data is represented by brackets «[ ]» that contain the list elements separated 
        by commas.
    </p>

        <code class="code">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>
        <code class="code">['a', 'b', 'c']</code>
        <code class="code">[1, 'a', True, [2, 3, 4]]</code>
    
    <h3>Tuples</h3>
    <p>Tuples are a data structure that allows multiple values ​​to be stored in a single object and accessed by their position in the tuple, but once 
        the tuple is created, the elements cannot be modified. Tuple-type data is represented by parentheses<code class="inline-code">( )</code>that contain the elements of the tuple separated by commas.
    </p>
        <code class="code">(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)</code>
        <code class="code">('a', 'b', 'c')</code>
        <code class="code">(1, 'a', True, (2, 3, 4))</code>
